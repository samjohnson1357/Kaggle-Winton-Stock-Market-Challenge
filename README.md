# Kaggle-Winton-Stock-Market-Challenge

In this project I use time series prediction tools to predict stock market returns for the Kaggle Winton Stock Market Challenge. You can read more about the challenge at https://www.kaggle.com/c/the-winton-stock-market-challenge. The code can be viewed in "Notebook.ipynb" and the conclusions I reach can be found in "Final Paper.pdf".
